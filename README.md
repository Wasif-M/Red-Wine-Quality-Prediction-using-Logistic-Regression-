# Prediction-of-Wine-Quality

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*2ayKmvVZCYaLPl-nmLLp5g.png">

For this project, I used Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10. For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7). The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:

    Fixed acidity
    Volatile acidity
    Citric acid
    Residual sugar
    Chlorides
    Free sulfur dioxide
    Total sulfur dioxide
    Density
    pH
    Sulfates
    Alcohol

Objectives

The objectives of this project are as follows:

    To experiment with different classification methods to see which yields the highest accuracy
    To determine which features are the most indicative of a good quality wine

Steps included in this project:

    Importing Lib
    Loading Data
    Understanding Data
    Missing Values
    Exploring Variables(Data Anylasis)
    Feature Selection
    Preparing Data for Modelling
    Applying Logistic Regression models
    Hurray you just completed the task !
    
CHEERS!
